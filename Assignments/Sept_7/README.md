# Process

This assignment was't very difficult, just tedious. The first part of making the portrait is to have a rough idea in mind. I decided to just try and make a crude version of myself, no fancy styles or anything. Once this was decided, now came the tedious part of trying to makes all the shapes work, by being proper sizes and being in the right positions. I also used [this site](https://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.html) to help out getting proper RGB colors. After a long process, I eventually ended up with this:

I ran into a few issues when trying to make the portrait. Mainly, it had to do with adding extra parts to the hair. I was trying to use `arc()` to make the hair more detailed, but I ran into issues with it not being the shape I wanted it to be when I tried to rotate it. The other issue was that I felt the background was a bit plain so I just added some randome color in the background at the end so it looks a bit less boring. Other than that however, there were no issues trying to figure out other functions and whatnot, just takes a while to shape and position everything correctly.
